    "Analyze index addition events for S&P indices since May 2022 to identify and backtest systematic trading opportunities.  \n",
    "Showcase thought process, technical skills, and decision-making in a real-world trading context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment Requirements Addressed:**\n",
    "- Use provided index event data (S&P 400/500/600) and end-of-day price data (Yahoo Finance).\n",
    "- Design and backtest strategies: Post-Announcement Momentum, Event Day Reversion, Buy-and-Hold, Hedged Momentum.\n",
    "- Explore holding periods, risk management, and hedging.\n",
    "- Apply liquidity and execution constraints.\n",
